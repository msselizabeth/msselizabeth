## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Elizabeth. I am passionate about solving problems  and creating user-friendly digital products. My background in sales, online marketing, and a degree in computer science gives me a strong blend of technical skills and a customer-centric focus. This combination allows me to build solutions that are not only functional but also aligned with user needs and business goals.
